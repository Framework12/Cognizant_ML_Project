## Project Description

The Sales Prediction Model uses machine learning techniques to analyze historical sales data and predict future sales trends. The goal is to provide businesses with a tool that aids in making strategic decisions, optimizing inventory, and improving overall sales performance.

## Features

- Utilizes historical sales data for training and prediction.
- Implements machine learning algorithms for accurate sales forecasts.
- Provides a user-friendly interface for inputting parameters and obtaining predictions.
- Supports integration into existing business systems.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and testing the model includes historical sales data with relevant features such as time, product details, and market conditions. The dataset is crucial for training a robust machine learning model.

## Dependencies

This project requires the following dependencies:
